# Decision Tree Learning Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of a decision tree learning algorithm for the car evaluation and bank marketing tasks, utilizing both categorical and numerical attributes.

## Contents

- `car_dataset.py`: Implementation of the decision tree algorithm for the car evaluation task.
- `bank_dataset.py`: Implementation of the modified decision tree algorithm for the bank marketing task.
- `run.sh`: Shell script to execute the training and evaluation process.
- `car/train.csv`: Training dataset for the car evaluation task (1,000 examples).
- `car/test.csv`: Test dataset for the car evaluation task (728 examples).
- `bank/train.csv`: Training dataset for the bank marketing task (5,000 examples).
- `bank/test.csv`: Test dataset for the bank marketing task (5,000 examples).
- `data-desc.txt`: Descriptions of the attributes used in both datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, and any others used in your implementation.

## Running the Code

To run the code and execute the decision tree learning tasks, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh run.sh
